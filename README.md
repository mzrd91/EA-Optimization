# Evolutionary Algorithm Parameter Optimization

## Overview
This project explores the effects of various parameters on the performance of evolutionary algorithms. The parameters under consideration include mutation rate, selection pressure, and population size. These parameters are crucial in determining the convergence speed, solution quality, and robustness of the algorithm. By experimenting with different settings for these parameters, the project aims to identify optimal configurations that enhance the effectiveness and efficiency of the algorithm.

## Purpose
The purpose of this project is to investigate the influence of key parameters on evolutionary algorithms:
- **Mutation Rate:** Controls the frequency and intensity of genetic changes in the population, impacting the exploration of the search space.
- **Selection Pressure:** Determines the competition intensity between individuals, affecting the exploitation of promising solutions.
  - High selection pressure may lead to premature convergence and local optima trapping.
  - Low selection pressure may result in insufficient exploitation and slow convergence.
- **Population Size:** Affects the diversity and density of the population, influencing the exploration-exploitation trade-off.
  - Small population size may lead to insufficient diversity and exploration.
  - Large population size may cause excessive computation and redundancy.

## Project Description
Evolutionary algorithms are a class of optimization algorithms inspired by natural selection and genetics. This project includes implementing and testing different selection algorithms and measuring their performance based on solution quality.
